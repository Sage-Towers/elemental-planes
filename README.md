# Sage Towers - Elemental Planes Image Collection Enhancement

Welcome to the Sage Towers Project, focused on the Elemental Planes Image Collection! This unique repository is dedicated to refining and enhancing a curated selection of images inspired by the Elemental Planes within the Sage Towers universe. Our goal is to fine-tune this collection by ensuring each image meets our high standards of quality and relevance. We're calling on our community's keen eyes and creative minds to help identify and correct images with anomalies, such as misplaced text and objects.

## Critical Enhancement Needs

The primary focus of this project is the identification and correction of images that contain:
- **Messed Up Text**: Text overlays that are incorrect, irrelevant, or nonsensical.
- **Messed Up Objects**: Objects that are out of place, distorted, or do not belong in the image.
- **Messed Up Filenames**: Some files have NaN in the file name, replace it with the right element.

These anomalies can significantly impact the quality and coherence of our collection. As we plan to use this refined data for further AI training and development, it's imperative that contributions focus on these aspects.
